# Michelle Faits

I got my Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience from Brandeis University. I got my PhD at WashU where I studied [how neurons grow](https://elifesciences.org/articles/11583#content), like my idol Rita Levi-Montalcini. 

I ran a startup for two years trying to keep MS patients safe from the [JC Virus](https://entrepreneurquarterly.com/ecosystem/pro-arc-diagnostics/). 

Then I became a data scientist, where so far I've routed a nationwide truck fleet, matched a million healthcare records to medical dictionaries, and plugged AI agents into the development side of R&D.
